## Installing with Boards Manager

Starting with 1.6.4, Arduino allows installation of third-party platform packages using Boards Manager. We have packages available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux (32 and 64 bit).

Install the current upstream Arduino IDE at the 1.8 level or later. The current version is at the Arduino website.
Start Arduino and open Preferences window.
Enter https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microBeesTech/microBees-Arduino/master/package_microBees_Boards_index.json into Additional Board Manager URLs field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.
Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and install microBees platform (and don't forget to select your microBees board from Tools > Board menu after installation).
